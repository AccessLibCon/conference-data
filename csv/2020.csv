2020,2020-10-19,9:00 - 10:15,Jessie Loyer (Mount Royal University),The (sometimes false) promise of technology in Indigenous language revitalization,"Indigenous languages are dying and technology can save them: true or false? Several big projects have emerged that follow this precise rhetoric: language apps, translation guides, VR tours. But what if Indigenous language revitalization is about waking up languages rather than saving them? What role does technology play if we shift how we consider language loss away from extinction, toward a more complex, messy relationship? We’ll discuss a number of language projects using technology tools for reclamation, including a recent project using Blackfoot language in augmented reality wayfinding at Mount Royal University, and consider how people working in these areas choose to embrace and reject technologies.",keynote,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSVja0DQyoDWx2Rq6Y2QThrpI21rEuXk/view?usp=sharing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asqx7-iRlE4&t=1302s,
