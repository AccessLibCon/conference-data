Barrett (Seton Hall University) | Lisa DeLuca (Seton Hall University),Starting Research Data Services during a Pandemic,"Prior to the pandemic, libraries have always been hubs for college students. The pandemic forced universities all over the world to shut down and move all services to online software platforms. Implementing a new library service may come with challenges especially during a pandemic. However there are many benefits to being able to effectively meet student and faculty research needs. In this proposal, we will present an approach we used during the pandemic to expand our research data services for our students and faculty. Our research data services team consists of three full time librarians, a part-time data specialist, and one student worker. The team took three key approaches to expansion: software acquisition, seeking additional funding, and collaborating university departments within and outside of SHU by using course syllabi to create training workshops. Attendees of this presentation may find it beneficial to learn from the practical example seen in expanding the library’s supportive service offerings.",talk,,,https://www.youtube.com/live/5uu3S8WnGX4?feature=shared&t=5217,
